# Interview-Exercises
A record of my solutions to technical interview questions

This repository is maintained as a workspace for all my code solutions to technical interview questions. Some of the prompts may be from
external sites such as Hackerrank.

All data structures used in my solutions are self-implemented in this same repository, save for arrays. In order to reflect the 
time-restricted nature of real technical interviews, the implementations lack any "convenience" methods that are commonly found in
the Java SE API. For instance, the Java implementation for LinkedList is doubly-linked and has methods to fetch elements by index, but my
LinkedList will not have these features.

If you have any interesting problems for me to solve, please email me at allen12@umd.edu!
